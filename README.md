# Robotic-Chain-Manipulation

This project implements a robotic chain consisting of multiple segments, allowing for dynamic manipulation and control. Users can initialize the robot with a specified number of segments, adjust segment lengths and angles, and perform forward kinematics to determine the end effector's position. The project is designed for educational purposes, demonstrating fundamental concepts in robotics and kinematics.
